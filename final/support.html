                            <li>The Medic, as the name implies, specializes in healing teammates and is thus one of the most important classes to have on a team.</li>
							<li>Aside from simple healing, the Medic can also overheal targets past their maximum health, increasing their survivability.</li>
							<li>The Medic can use an Übercharge to grant powerful, temporary buffs to teammates such as invulnerability or triple damage.</li>
							<li>Well timed pushes with an Übercharge can instantly change the tide of a game, bringing a team back from defeat or crushing the other.</li>
							<li>Generally, the Medic has a hard time defending himself from attacking enemies, so he needs to be protected for maximum efficiency.</li>
                        </ul></li>

                            <li>The Sniper exceedes at picking of enemies from a distance, and is able to take out nearly any enemy with a single headshot.</li>
							<li>Due to his superior long range attacks, the Sniper is best positions away from the front lines, in a position with good visibility.</li>
							<li>The class is ideal for taking out high value enemies, such as Medics or Heavies, as they can do so without putting themself in too much harm.</li>
							<li>Enemy Snipers are one of the Sniper's greatest enemies, with a duel between then usually ending in a single blow from whoever can hit it first.</li>
							<li>Stationary Snipers are also an easy target for Spies, so watching out for suspicious activity or using the Razorback can help fight them off.</li>
                        </ul></li>

						<ul>
                            <li>Similar to the Sniper, the Spy is perfect for eliminating valuable enemy targets, but does so through stealth and subterfuge.</li>
							<li>The Spy's main method of elimination is stabbing an enemy in the back with one of his knives, capable of instantly killing any target.</li>
							<li>Additionally, he has access to a Sapper for destroying enemy buildings, and a Revolver for ranged combat or finishing off low health enemies.</li>
							<li>In order to successfully get behind enemy lines, the Spy can disguise himself as an enemy to blend in and sneak around for an opportunity to kill.</li>
							<li>Acting like the class one has disguised as can help fool enemies, but some disguises such as Scouts throw off hitboxes, making the Spy harder to hit.</li>
                        </ul></li>
