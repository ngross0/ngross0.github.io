                            <li>Both of the Demoman's default weapons can deal a large amount of damage and have a long range, making him effective in many situations.</li>
							<li>In defensive situations, the Stickybomb launchers can be used to set traps for enemies as well as clear key areas like control points.</li>
							<li>Additionally, his weapons are ideal for taking out enemy Engineer nests, with a single detonation able to destroy many buildings at once.</li>
							<li>Similar to the Soldier, the Demoman has low foot speed, high health, and is able to propel himself great distances with his explosive weapons.</li>
							<li>The Demoman also has swords and shields, unlocking an entirely new playstyle: one able to quickly charge in and eliminate single targets.</li>

							<li>With the highest health pool and one of the highest DPS weapons in the game, the Heavy makes for a great asset on any team.</li>
							<li>His slow movement speed is his biggest setback, making it difficult for him to arrive at a battlefield at the same pace as his allies.</li>
							<li>This also makes him a prime target for Snipers and Spies, both of which are able to take him out with a single blow.</li>
							<li>Heavies paired up with Medics are a classic image, for good reason. Invulnerable Heavies are a nearly unstopable offensive or defensive force.</li>
							<li>Additonally, the Heavy posses secondary weapons that can be used to heal his teammates, keeping Medics or other allies alive in a fight.</li>
                        </ul>

                            <li>The Engineer can build a variety of buildings to support his team. He must manage his metal wisely to keep them operating properly.</li>
							<li>Sentry Guns are good for defending key areas and can deal a lot of damage very quickly. They can even be used offensively which smart placement.</li>
							<li>Dispensers are invauluable for keeping a team at full health and ammo, and should be positioned somewhere near the front where teammates can quickly use it.</li>
							<li>Teleporters can quickly move allies to the front lines, useful for maintaining a well-fortified defensive line, or for keeping constant offensive pressure.</li>
							<li>Stationary buildings are an easy target for enemies, so the Engineer is most effective when supported by his teammates.</li>
