                    <p>The Offense Class catagory includes the Scout, Soldier, and Pyro. </p>
					<p>They posses good health, mobility, or both making them generally well suited for fighting at the front. </p>
					<p>Flanking and ambushes are also effective strategies these classes excel at. </p>

                    <p>The Defense Class catagory includes the Demoman, Heavy, and Engineer. </p>
					<p>They posses high health, and strong defensive options, but relatively low mobility. </p>
					<p>In addition to being effective defenders, these classes can also be strong on the front line.</p>

                    <p>The Support Class catagory includes the Medic, Sniper, and Spy. </p>
					<p>Instead of fighting at the front themselves, they are more suited to supporting from the back. </p>
					<p>A single well timed action from these classes has the potential to shift the tides of battle instantly. </p>
