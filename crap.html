                    <h1>Bad Site</h1>
                    <h2><u><a href="http://moviethemes.net">Movie Themes</a></u></h2>
                    <p><strong>The website attempts to download a .mid file when clicking the link. Do not allow this.</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>C.</b> The contrast on this website is just.... wow, it's bad. The purple background, the yellow text, the bright neon dividers. It's painful on the eyes and really not appealing to look at. The website would be much better just be smoothing out the background into a solid, darker color.</li>
                        <li><b>R.</b> I must admit, moviethemes.net really got the repetition down... in a way. As you scroll down the website, the links and segments follow a repetitive display pattern. Since it follows relatively decent repetition, I'm not sure much needs changed, although dividing it into two side-by-side columns would be better.</li>
                        <li><b>A.</b> The website is aligned for sure, but it's not aligned well. It appears haphazard, like aligning it in the center was an afterthought and nobody really thought about how it would look. The alignment would be better, as I stated in the previous point, if it was separated into columns for music genres, maybe even in a grid.</li>
                        <li><b>P.</b> Everything is in close proximity to everything else, so everything similar is grouped together and divided up, but it's still an eyesore to view and it just generally doesn't work. The proximity of the elements would be better served by grouping genres and eras together into a grid/chart, with colors evened out to look nicer.</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
                <div class="right">
                    <h1>Good Site</h1>
                    <h2><u><a href="https://www.valvesoftware.com/en">Valve Software</a></u></h2>
                    <p>Valve site design adheres to C.R.A.P. principles.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>C.</b> The contrast on the Valve Software website is quite good, with a nice red text over darker photos and videos of employees working. Job listings are shown very well in white contrast sections opened by clicking on the red categories.</li>
                        <li><b>R.</b> The Valve Software website has excellent repetition, as each job category opens up to a white square with black text for job openings. This repetition tells the visitor exactly what to expect.</li>
                        <li><b>A.</b> The alignment for Valve Website is rather interesting, as the job categories are not aligned with the left or center, but with the center-left, and it works very well for visual appeal.</li>
                        <li><b>P.</b> The proximity is well done for Valve Software, especially since each job category is separate from unrelated jobs, and so they are all together as they should be.</li>
