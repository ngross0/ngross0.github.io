            <ul>
                <li>Personal Background: I'm originally from Pomeroy, Ohio but have lived in Manteo, North Carolina since June of 2015. I enjoy Star Wars, Star Trek, Warhammer 40k (really anything SciFi or Fantasy actually) and enjoy streaming on Twitch.</li>
                <li>Professional Background: I have worked as a receptionist at a car dealership, a host at a restaurant, a research assistant at UNCC, and most recently as a Sales Associate at J. Crew.</li>
                <li>Academic Background: I am a junior majoring in Computer Science with a concentration in Cyber Security and with a minor in Philosophy.</li>
                <li>Background in ITIS 3135 Subject Matter: I have been making websites (without publishing them) since high school, often using them to display information for projects instead of PowerPoint presentations or similar.</li>
                <li>Primary Computer Platform: My desktop PC runs Windows 10 for the purposes of gaming, although I mainly use Linux distributions on my laptop and have multiple virtual machines as I greatly prefer Linux (specifically Arch or Manjaro). I would switch my desktop to Linux if it was fully compatible with all of the games I play, but as of yet it is not. If I could get it working, I would switch to Windows 8.1 as it was my favorite Windows release.</li>
                <li>Courses I'm Taking And Why: <br>
                    <ul>
                        <li>ITIS 3135: I am taking Web App Design and Development as it is required for my concentration, but I also find it extremely interesting how websites are laid out (although I very much do not enjoy using JavaScript).</li>
                        <li>ITSC 3155: I am taking Software Engineering as it is a required course for Computer Science, but I also enjoy learning about development methodologies so that I can practice them for myself and better learn to work in the field.</li>
                        <li>ITIS 3246: I am taking IT Infrastructure and Security out of both necessity for my concentration and interest in how computers work on a deeper level.</li>
                        <li>ITCS 3050: I am taking Topics in Computer Science out of interest in the nature of underrepresented students in Computer Science. It is related to a scholarship I have and involves working with middle school students to help them learn computer science and realize they, too, can go into the field.</li>
                        <li>PHIL 1105: Since I am minoring in Philosophy, Critical Thinking is in my courseload for the semester since it is one of the earlier courses in my Philosophy minor.</li>
                        <li>STAT 2122: I have absolutely no interest in math of any kind, but I am taking statistics as it's a required course for Computer Science majors.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Fact About Me: I'm autistic!</li>
                <li>Extra Info: I have a cat named Arya and a dog named Kenobi.</li>
            </ul>
